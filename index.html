      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Houston and spent the last four years living on drilling rigs all over the country and a few offshore. I have a mom, a smom (step-mom), a dad, two older brothers, two sis-in-laws, a niece who started at UT this semester, two nephews, a boyfriend, and a 220 lb English Mastiff, named George. I like pina coladas, getting caught in the rain, I'm totally into yoga, definitely have half a brain, not into health food, and occasionally into champagne.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Waimea, Hawaii many many moons ago. I lived in the Bahamas for a year and four years in Salt Lake City. However, the majority of my life has taken place in Houston. I am a Texan through and through!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love watching the Houston Texans (even though they consistently disappoint me). I feel great when I do yoga, I just need to do it more regularly. I'm a mediocre golfer and tennis player but still enjoy embarrassing myself. I'm currently attempting to learn how to wakeboard and wakesurf, which can be very painful for my ego and body.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I still haven't figured that out yet, but I think I might be on the right track.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I recently moved to Austin, TX and spend most of my time on Lake Travis.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>That's a good question... I think the combination of technical and creative skills required to create something that is functional and aesthetically pleasing would be very satisfying.</p>
